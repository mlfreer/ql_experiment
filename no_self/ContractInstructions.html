Thank you for completing Part I of the experiment! We are now proceeding to the next stage of the experiment. Please remain calm and study the instructions. You will be able to proceed shortly after all participants would finish the Part I.

<br><br>

In this part you would be presented with <b> 20 decision making problems</b>. 
Each of them contains <b>10 alternatives</b>. 
Each alternative is a contract, that is the amount of money you would receive for the given number of tasks. 
The tasks are similar to those you have completed in the Part I.
Hence, each menu would contain the payment you would receive if you decide to do <b>1,2,3,â€¦,10 tasks</b>. However, you need to pick one of the contracts. Please take the choice carefully, because it would define the number of tasks and the compensation you would receive in the Part III. Picture below presents the decision screen you would face.

<br><br>

<br><br>

After taking all of these decisions, <b> one of 20 decision tasks </b> would be randomly (with equal probability) picked and your choice from this budget will be implemented in the Part III. That is, you would have to finish the number of tasks corresponding the one you have chosen in this budget and the compensation would be equal to the compensation corresponding to the number of tasks you chosen within the budget.

<br><br>

Please not that <b>you will have to wait until all the players complete this Part of the experiment</b>.
Therefore, <b>please take your decisions responsibly</b> as the <b>decisions made in this part are binding</b>.
In the <b>next part</b> in which contract will be implemented <b>you would not have to wait for other participants</b>.
That is you would be free to receive your payment and go once you will fulfill one of the contracts you are going to choose in this stage.
Therefore, only your efficiency in completing the tasks would determine how long it would take you to fulfill the task and when you would be able to leave.
Hence, <b>please pick your most preferred contracts</b>.
