Thank you for completing Part I of the experiment! We are now proceeding to the next stage of the experiment. Please read the instructions carefully. You will be able to proceed shortly after all participants finish Part I.

<br><br>

In this part, you will be asked to make <b>20</b> decisions. Each decision consists of choosing one of 10 possible alternatives from a menu. Each alternative in a menu is a contract. Each contract specifies how much you will be paid if you complete a certain number of data entering tasks. The tasks are similar to those you just completed in Part I. Each menu contains the payment you would receive if you complete 1, 2, 3, â€¦, or 10 tasks. Figure 4 shows an example of a menu you might face. The first option offers $4.02 for completing one task, $6.51 for completing two tasks, etc.

<br><br>

After choosing one alternative from <b>each of the 20 menus</b>, one of the menus will be chosen at random (with equal probability). Your choice in this menu will then be implemented in Part III of the experiment. That is, you will have to finish the number of tasks corresponding to the alternative you chose in this menu.  You will also receive the compensation corresponding to the option you chose.

<br><br>

Please make your decisions carefully. They will determine the number of tasks and the compensation you will receive in Part III.
