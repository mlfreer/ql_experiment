In this part, you will be asked to input data. You will be presented with a scanned version of one of the pages of the 1876 Peruvian Census together with a screen to input the data. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the actual screen you will face in this part of the experiment. If you do not see the submit button, please scroll to the bottom of the screen.

The system has internal checks to make sure that the data is input correctly. The system will inform you if you have made a typo. The system will also help you locate typos by highlighting the row or column where the typos are. Figure 2 illustrates how the screen identifies the location of a typo.

Given the difficulty of the task, the system will allow for a few mistakes. The permitted number of mistakes increases with the number of rows and columns in the table. The computer will enable you to progress to the next task once you have entered the data without exceeding the permitted number of mistakes. To check and fix potential mistakes, please check the following <b>control sums (using a calculator if necessary)</b>:

<br>

<ul>
  <li>
    The number at the bottom of every column is the sum of all the numbers above it
  </li>
  <li>
    In every row, the sum of the numbers in the two columns previous to the last column must add up to the number in the last column.
  </li>
</ul>


In addition to the guidelines above, please feel free to employ these <b>hints</b>:


<ul>
    <li>
        The symbol <b>“...”</b> must be replaced with <b>0</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Number <b>0</b> could indeed be <b>6</b> or <b>8</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Number <b>9</b> could indeed be <b>8</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><br>

Once you have input the data with sufficiently few errors, the computer will allow you to submit your decision and proceed to the following table. This is illustrated in Figure 3.
