Thank you for completing Part II of the experiment! We are now proceeding to the next stage of the experiment. Please read the instructions carefully. You will be able to proceed shortly after all participants finish Part II.

<br><br>

Please choose an alternative from each one of the next 20 menus. Once you make all your decisions, you will be presented with the selected task and the corresponding payment. Once you complete the specified tasks, you will see the final screen with your payment information. <b>You DO NOT NEED to wait for other participants</b>. Please record your <b>label</b> and quietly proceed to collect your payment.

<br><br>

In this part, you will complete tasks as in Part I. The system will randomly pick one of the budgets you have faced and implement the choice you have made. You will see the contract implemented on the screen, as illustrated in Figure 5.

Recall that you will need to input the data from the scanned paper (presented on the left side of the screen) to the input form (shown on the right side of the screen), precisely as you have done in Part I. You will be paid only after completing all the tasks you have agreed to do beforehand.

<br><br>

Please consult the instructions of Part I for a reminder of the rules and hints for completing the tasks.
