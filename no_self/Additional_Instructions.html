Note that the complexity of tasks is heterogeneous, in both amount of data to be entered and the quality of the picture.
You will be presented with randomly selected task on the next screen.
Each of them contains from from 3 to 10 lines and 12 columns.
Please find some examples of the pictures used for the tasks below.

<table class="table">
    <tr class="row">
        <td class="column">
        <img src="{{static 'ql_experiment/15.jpg' }}" alt="example task" style="width:100%"/>
        </td>
        <td class="column">
        <img src="{{static 'ql_experiment/12.jpg' }}" alt="example task" style="width:100%"/>
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr class="row">
    <td class="column">
        <img src="{{static 'ql_experiment/14.jpg' }}" alt="example task" style="width:100%"/>
    </td>
    <td class="column">
        <img src="{{static 'ql_experiment/16.jpg' }}" alt="example task" style="width:100%"/>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <br><br>
    </tr>

    <tr class="row">
    <td class="column">
        <img src="{{static 'ql_experiment/9.jpg' }}" alt="example task" style="width:100%"/>
    </td>
    <td class="column">
        <img src="{{static 'ql_experiment/13.jpg' }}" alt="example task" style="width:100%"/>
    </td>
    </tr>

Please take into account that if you observe a picture with 9 lines and which is hard to read, it is likely among the most complicated tasks.
On the other hand if you observe a picture with 3 lines and ideally printed numbers it is likely among the easiest tasks.
There is enough tasks of all levels of complexity, so if you received a very easy or a very complicated task in the practice does not affect the chance of you receiving easy or complicated tasks further on.
Finally, in this Part of the experiment <b>you would have to end until all participants in the room is finished to proceed further</b>.
